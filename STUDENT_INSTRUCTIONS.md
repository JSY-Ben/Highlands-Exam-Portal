# ExamSubs Student Instructions

This guide explains how students access exams, download materials, and submit their work.

## Download the materials you need for the exam.
1. On the student portal, click "Download Exam Materials" on the exam card.
2. You can choose to download a single file or all materials at once as a ZIP file.
3. If a password is required, you will be prompted first. Enter the password provided to you. The system will log when you have downloaded the exam materials.
4. Once the download is complete, you should be able to access the files from your Downloads folder in Windows Explorer (PC) or Finder (Mac)

## How to Submit your Files for an exam
1. Open the Student portal.
2. Select the exam and click "Submit Files".
3. If prompted, enter the exam access password and/or your student password provided to you. 

## Once the exam page has loaded
1. Enter your name and candidate number (or select your name from the dropdown menu if there is one instead of a text box). If a password has been provided you for submission, your name will be automatically filled in for you already.
2. Each document that is requested for you to submit for this exam has its own file upload box. Upload the required documents.
3. When a document is uploaded, it will tell you when the document was last saved/modified. If the date/time displayed is earlier than the date/time you last worked on the file, it is possible you didn't save or upload the latest version. Make sure to check before you submit. You can remove the file and upload the latest version if necessary.
4. Click the checkbox to confirm you are ready to submit the files uploaded as your final submission.
5. Click "Submit Files".

## Replace a submission
- If a submission already exists, the portal will warn you.
- Confirm the replacement checkbox to submit again and replace your original submission. Your original submission will be archived but it will not be graded.

## Cancel a submission
- Use "Cancel submission" to return to the exam list. This also clears your register password session, if used.
